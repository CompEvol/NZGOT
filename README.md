=====

The toolkit is initially designed to analyse various types of data collected from 
New Zealand Genomic Observatory project, but we hope these tools would become useful 
and reusable tools for data analysis in bioinformatics and ecology.

The whole software has the dependencies on BioJava (http://biojava.org) and 
JEBL (http://jebl.sourceforge.net). Each tool should have its core package containing 
its main code, and also few owners who have its copyright and are resposible to 
maintain it. 

It contains the following tools:

1) Community matrix analysis.
Core package: nzgot.cma
Owners: Walter Xie, Alexei Drummond

2) The data correction for next-generation sequencing data.
Core package: 
Owners:
